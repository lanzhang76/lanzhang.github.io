          <p>
            <h4>Audience:</h4>
            Office-based workers <h4>Topic:</h4>
            A virtual community that urges stressful workers to take a vacation
            <h4>Activity:</h4>
            Count down for the one thing that’s good for coping their workplace stress – TAKE VACATION
            <h4>problem:</h4>
            Workplace can be stressful and draining on one’s mental health. For those that work from 9-5 on weekdays, weekends are our short break to take a breather. For some that work overtime all the time, that short break doesn’t exist unless we officially file for sick days or days off. The average employed U.S. adult works 1,811.16 hours per year. In 2017, the average worker in America with five years of experience at a company was given 15 days of PTOs each year. People who take vacations have lower stress, less risk of heart disease, a better outlook on life, and more motivation to achieve goals at work. While knowing how important it is to be outside of office, we do spend a great deal of our time in. 
            How do we bring the mental benefit of taking vacation to the stressed individuals while they are at work? 
            How do we build a community around the collective workplace stress that office-based employees share?
            How do we quantify and add up the individual desire for workplace stress outlet to represent a universal problem and a collective sentiment?

            For this round of prototype, I conducted(will continue) in-person interviews with People
            who are currently or previously working in an office setting in order for me to find
            better insights:
