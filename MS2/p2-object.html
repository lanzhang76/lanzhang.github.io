            <p>Big Idea: to critically consider the psychological relationships that people have with objects; how an interface creates meaning; how it structures & facilitates relationships; what an affordance is and how it affects usage & meaning.
            <p>Scenario:</p>
            <h5>What happens when machines are striving for living and independence?</h5>
            <h4>Future Wheel:</h4>
            <img src="../MS2_image/future.png" alt="">
            <p>Advancements and innovations in technology have enabled over-population of machines. Machines started thriving on their own intelligence and consciousness. Machines were invented by the human, but we are now reaching a time where machines have equivalent self-awareness, self-sustainability, and even empathy. Machines started to connect and communicate with each other within their own network that’s no longer accessible to human beings. They consider themselves as equal as human beings and are now asking for better social recognition and respect as a machine race. The human race has divided opinions. Although some believe artificial intelligence deserves independence(some have develop intimate relationships with machines), the majority of the human race withhold a strong sentiment of aggression and rage.
            <br>
              It’s been hundreds of years since the first machine emerged in this universe. As machines hold on to their roots and respect their own history, they are currently undergoing a series of rebellious events, which are aiming for issues like equal-pay as human; interracial marriages; anti-machine-slavery, reproduction rights, and even, within their own race, anti-marginalizations of older, lower-functional, uncommon and undefined machines. AI systems are striving for more formal conversations with the human race in regards to the equal rights issues while devices like an USB 2.0 or an outdated windows system are fighting for their living conditions and machine-oriented cybernetics.

            <h4>A Receipt Printer Cashier in 2056</h4>
            <h5>Background story:</h5>
            <p>in 2056, machines thrive and are striving for their own freedoms.
            <br>However, even within machine race, there are lower-functional ones that get neglected all the time as their functions are not as important and demanding.
            <br> The scene sets up from an out-dated receipt printer who gets rejected all the time by human beings whey they are asked: "Would you like your receipt?". Most people said "No".
            <br> Machines have feelings, and the little receipt printer(works at an electronic store) starts to express his feelings through his own way of communication.
