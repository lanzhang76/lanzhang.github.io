            <h3> Empathy Machine</h3>

              Facts:
              <br>
              <br>* Scientific Name: Asteroidea
              <br>* Echinoderms/Phylum Echinodermata
              <br>* Carnivores/Marine invertebrates
              <br>* Live Up to 35 years
              <br>* 4.7 to 9.4 inch
              <br>* An echinoderm has no obvious left or right body, but top or bottom side
              <br>* Not fish but echinoderm, closer to sea urchin or sand dollars
              <br>* They have tube feet or podia (Oceanicresearc.org)
              <br>* expand and extract the tube feet, they walk
              <br>* “Benthic” – Living at the bottom
              <br>* bilateral - Two sides
              <br>* bumps on the body surface are called “Dermal Branchiae” - used to absorb oxygen
              <br>* pedicellaria on the skin are used to pluck things off
              <br>* Madreporite - single colored spot–used to filter water between the water vascular and the ocean
              <br>* The sea star has a light-sensitive organs at the tip of each ray, called an eye spot. It detects the presence and direction of light, and the seem to have idea where it is headed
              <br>* Starfish has no brains or blood, but its nervous system is spread through its arms
              <br>* Starfish have one eye on each tip of the arm

            </p>

            <p>
              Starfish' main cool features:
              <br>
              <br>* Limbs regeneration
              <br>* Starfish’s “Eyes” and nervous system are spread on the arms(no brain or blood), their entire arms are a connected sensor
              <br>* When feeding, starfish evert their stomach out through their mouth and it goes back after digestion
            </p>

            <p>
              Empathy Machine brainstorming ideas:
            <br>* Eating outside of the body–an intensive tongue/external stomach to grab food
            <br>* Regeneration of our body parts?
            <br>* With eyes covered(sea stars don’t have eyes like us), and only use our hands as our navigating tools and the nervous system. At tip of each arm, there’s an “eyespot” that’s sensing the light, giving our arm instruction of where to go
            <br>* When our human body functions as a five-tenable sea star; We can only move on the floor with top and bottom sides
            <br>* When our hands(five fingers) work as two sea stars. At each finger tip, there’s a light sensor that’d give muscle stimuli
