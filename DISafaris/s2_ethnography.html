            <h3> Californian Condors / Gymnogyps californianus</h3>

              <h4>Observation Documentation:</h4>
              I went on San Diego Zoo Live cam to observe Californian Condors. I recorded the live cam while taking notes on my paper.
              Then I realized the condos don't move much at all. It makes sense since they are in a protective enclosed setting.
              Thus I decided to use Processing and OpenCV to experiment documenting the minimal movement of condors within such an enclosed environment.

              <p>Utilizing background subtraction, motion/blob tracking, the movement will be highlighted against the still background.
                I used red to outline the movement and highlighted the different times of moving. For example, when Condor C flew up to the branch
                and nudged Condor B off.

              Discoveries:
              <br>
              Live Cam can be very unstable. The image is always glitchy, which can interfere with the quality of ethnography
              <br>
              Some actions are very subtle to be observed from a far distance
              <br>
              The sound is not recorded through the Live Cam, so for creatures like birds, without sound, there’re a lot of actions and meanings be missed.
              <br>
              Condors are endangered species. They are also flying creatures who wouldn’t be able to fly much under the zoo monitoring. Most of the time, they are sitting around in front of the cam, unable to fly. Maybe the zoo setting isn’t the best environment to observe condors’ natural behaviors

                  <h4>Observation Documentation:</h4>
                I had a dilemma doing this observation in particular. I would have no access or proper opportunities to observing
                the deers if it wasn’t because we poured corns on the ground near us. I understand the ideal situation is when
                there’s no human intervention or disturbance through the ethnography, but again without such a control environment,
                I wouldn’t even have a chance to get to see the deers.
