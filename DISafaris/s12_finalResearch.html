          <h3>Final Project Update</h3>

          <p>
            Big Idea: to refine Lemur Buddy in terms of its functionality and
            practical goal; Work towards testing it with real RTL.

          <h4>Reach-Out Process Updates:</h4>
          <p>
            1. Duke Lemur Center Research Program - getting in touch with
            program director for a potential testing <br />2. San Diego Zoo RTL
            Technicians - waiting for a round of refined questions
          </p>
          <p>The latest project proposal brief and questions:</p>

          <p>
            One main feedback from DLC is: <br />interacting with the device
            could, potentially, catch the eye of the females and set the males
            up to be targeted, and such a device could potentially be used for
            lemurs that need to be physically separated.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I need to further investigae:The gender-targeted role of
            this device: is it truly effective?
            <br />
            1. Consider Sexual Selection theory: a potential hormonal mechanism
            of "masculinization" in female lemur development <br />2. To figure
            out the specific scenarios where male lemurs would need such
            devices. <br />3. Potentially, it can still be used for
            hospitalization and transition from inidvidual separation back to
            the social group environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my research, breeding season seems to be the time where male
            lemurs are in more of a stress as they are in competition for
            females, and their scent diveristy shows their genetic complexity,
            which affects how females make decisions when picking a partner as
            well.
