          <h3>Experts Feedback</h3>
          <h4>
            Question 1: whether ring-tailed lemur would interaction with the
            device or not:
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span>San Diego Zoo RTL caretakers:</span>
            Unlike most non-human primates, lemurs have a reputation of being
            apprehensive to approach and interact with novel objects. However, I
            have seen many instances where it just takes time. We installed belt
            feeders with our RTL at the Safari Park and it took 2 weeks for them
            to receive the food reward and another 2 weeks until they were
            dismantling it. I believe
            <mark>the RTL would be curious about your proto-type</mark>
            but might take some patience on our end to see an interaction.
            <br /><br />
            <span>Duke Lemur Center Technicians:</span> Yes, we all agree that
            the
            <mark>RTL are intelligent enough to interact with the device.</mark>
            The question is, will they? As you are developing this for satellite
            males, interacting with the device could, potentially, catch the eye
            of the females and set the males up to be targeted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Conclusion:</span>Yes, Ring-tailed Lemurs would interact with
            this device.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Question2: Do Ring-tailed lemurs use other objects to groom
            themselves?
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span>San Diego Zoo RTL caretakers:</span>
            RTL that live in social groups spend much time grooming each other
            but
            <mark>will also use branches, poles and platforms to rub on.</mark>

            <br /><br />
            <span>Duke Lemur Center Technicians:</span> The techs
            <mark>do not see </mark>the animals using other devices (branches,
            tree trunks) for grooming. They say that if allogrooming is not
            occurring, then those areas that they can’t self groom get a bit
            ragged.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Conclusion:</span>Ring-tailed lemurs at the center do not use
            other devices to groom while the ones at the San Diego Zoo tend to
            use branches, poles and platforms to rub on. That implies it’s
            possible for the lemurs to try to groom themselves with the right
            affordance.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Question3: Is the device beneficial to the lone male Ring-tailed
            lemurs? Do you see potential for its usability?
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span>San Diego Zoo RTL caretakers:</span>
            We often have primates that are singly housed for various medical or
            management issues. I think this device could be used for species
            other than RTL that are <mark>socially isolated.</mark>

            <br /><br />
            <span>Duke Lemur Center Technicians:</span> There may be other
            species that would interact with it more, but those are not
            necessarily animals that are “socially left out”. It perhaps would
            be best for <mark>solitary animals?</mark> Occasionally animals need
            to be pulled for medical reasons with the goal of getting them back
            to the troop/partner asap.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Conclusion:</span> Both sites provide me feedback that’s in
            regards to using this all-grooming device for primates that are
            isolated for medical or management reasons. I guess it’s a common
            case for the zoo/center to separate a lemur or other animals that
            are temporarily pulled out from its original social group. Both
            feedbacks provided a good insight into considering this as a social
            compensation device that could be utilized, either within the
            individually housed context or a transition period for one going
            back to its original large group.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Question4: Suggested materials and affordance?
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span>San Diego Zoo RTL caretakers:</span>
            We generally look for materials that are not easy to destroy or
            ingest such as hard plastic. In addition, using materials that can
            be cleaned is essential. Safety considerations often vary by species
            and by individual animal. If there are wires and other components
            involved it is necessary that they are secured in a way that animals
            do not have access to them.

            <br /><br />
            <span>Duke Lemur Center Technicians:</span> In regards to attracting
            the lemurs, a variety of scents could be used – garlic is one that
            is commonly used. However, if it attracts the males it will also
            attract the female.
          </p>
          <h4>Overall Conclusion:</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                1. In terms of creating affordance with the lone male
                ring-tailed lemurs, it can be speculated that if one is put in
                close context with the device, they will be smart and curious
                enough to use it. If not, rubbing garlic or their own body odor
                will be the attractor. If it’s placed in a context where one is
                separated from the social group, then it shouldn’t be a worry
                that it will also attract female lemurs.
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                2. The materials I will use and iterate with will focus on the
                durability and safety qualities. I will use mainly silicone for
                the body as it’s durable, rubbery, food-safe, waterproof and
                easy to clean. The main rubber massage part will be rubbery
                plastic that’s utilized by pet store, which will also be safe
                when being exposed to the Ring-tailed lemurs. The electronic
                part and wires will be sealed safely.
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                3. The Allo-grooming device
                <mark
                  >can be seen as a social interaction compensation by
                  caretakers from both sites</mark
                >, which met the original goal of creating such a device.
                However, the extent of whether or not it’s exclusively suitable
                for male Ring-tailed lemurs is not assured. Both consider this
                as something that should be used for other primates that are
                socially left out as well, which is a good sign as it represents
                a common need across many primates that live in a social
                culture.
              </p>

          <hr />
          <p>
            As I’d like to ensure that the allo-grooming device could not only
            work for socially left-out primates but also truly for the lone male
            RTL, I dived deeper into how the RTL social structure and their
            grooming as a displayed social behavior. From my research,
            <mark
              >the RTLs in a captivated behavior displayed an issue as well as a
              real “market” need that such a device can find its useful position
              for.</mark
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            In the paper “ Grooming and touching behaviour in captive
            ring-tailed lemurs”, I found a valuable observation that closely
            watched and compared the dynamic within the social troop in relation
            to their grooming social behavior as social hierarchy(represented in
            their sleeping order).
          </p>
          <div style="width:55%">
            <img src="../image/lemur_final/lemur_stat.png" alt="" />
          </div>

          <p>
            This chart shows that age and gender responds to social hierarchy
            within the troop in a captivated environment. F1 is not only the
            oldest but also a female RTL. She always gets to sleep first and
            gets most touching from other RTLemurs. F2 is younger but because
            she is female, she is comparatively the same as the older and the
            leading male lemur. Meanwhile M4 who is probably the youngest but
            also a male Ring-tailed lemur who initiates most touching and came
            last in the sleeping order. This proves that there could really be a
            case where a young, male ring-tailed lemur is socially ranked-low to
            a point that he is not receiving much touching from other RTlemurs.
            “Our results indicate that in this group grooming occurs primarily
            between the older and (according to sleep order) higher ranking
            animals. This is consistent with what has been observed in other
            primate species (see, for example, SEYFART8, 1980). Touching,
            however, is primarily done by younger animals to older animals, and
            by subordinates to dominants.” In the research, they also concluded
            that “"reach out and touch" contact is a submissive gesture in the
            ring-tailed lemur.”
            <br />That made me wonder if male lemurs would just groom each there
            so even the lower-ranking lemurs can enjoy grooming as a social
            behavior? Typically the answer is no because "Affiliation, tolerance
            and cooperation should occur less frequently among males than among
            females, since male repro ductive success is tied to inter-male
            competition over access to receptive female”. However, “social
            friendly activities such as allogrooming, huddling, and sitting and
            resting in”seem to be something observed among males too. But since
            male RTL and male RTL are less likely to offer “touch” and
            receive”grooming” to each other because of their mutually exclusive
            social goals, it gave me a better idea that male RT lemurs M3 and
            M4(especially) are my targets who’d be in a suitable social position
            for an allogrooming device: They are socially low-ranked; They do
            not receive any grooming offering; They wouldn’t groom each other.
          </p>

          <h4>Thus physical making iteration:</h4>

          Some important feedback I got from the last round of iteration is:
          <li>
            <p>
              1. It’s good to take off the rollers as it’s simpler without
              losing a purpose.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              2. The device looks too much like a backpack, the shape needs to
              be totally making sense for exclusively RTL
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>3. The beans will make noise</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              4. Too much fur, integrate parts into one main material: use
              silicone
            </p>
          </li>

          <p>
            sketch:
          </p>
          <img src="../image/lemur_final/final_diagramB-01.png" alt="" />

          <h4>
            Making:
          </h4>
          <p>
            I decided to make the entire body silicone, including the massage
            pad. In my head, I thought I could make everything smoothly
            beautiful by hand, and I will just cut out the part where I will be
            storing my electronics in the back. Since the body is semi-bouncy,
            it could potentially work without even a furry outer coat? I also
            found a home-made silicone sculpture recipe that I really want to
            try. Apparently, mixing no1 100% silicone with corn starch would
            give me 10-15 minutes of molding time before it turns into a bouncy,
            durably hard object. The corn starch is supposed to make it less
            sticky and easier to work with(like bread or pasta dough).
          </p>
          <img src="../image/lemur_final/IMG_2115-2.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            I started with making the mold of the massage pad from alginate. It
            didn’t take long for the alginate to set, which was very easy.
            However, since alginate is water-based, and it was impossible to get
            the non-liquid, insanely sticky silicone(even without the corn
            starch)to go into the wet mold with tiny, deep holes in it. I ended
            up failing making a silicone massage pad, but it’s okay, the pad can
            stayed as is–hard plastic.
          </p>
          <img src="../image/lemur_final/IMG_2115-3.jpg" alt="" />

          <p>
            Then I started to handling the silicone. I cut out shape of my
            device surface/supports from foam to use as my references when
            molding. Since the home-made recipe makes the silicone doughy, so
            it’s actually better to form with hands. I did a pretty good job
            molding my base–smooth and perfectly shape. As I’m running out of
            corn starch(after two bottles of it), it became insanely difficult
            to shape the silicone top on top of my original base.
          </p>
          <img src="../image/lemur_final/IMG_2168.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            I ended up with a very coarse-looking device that has a pretty lumpy
            surface. I added two little hooks to hook the massage pad in, so it
            can be easily detached and washed. The entire body can be washed
            too, as it’s water-proof. Although, the look and the texture are not
            perfect(not a ready-to-sell product in the market), the shape and
            physiology should work well with an actual RT lemur as it’s big
            enough for them to sit in front while being held from the side legs
            and it’s roundly pointy enough from the back, which allows one to
            hug and hold from behind. I’m considering add the zipper fur back as
            a way to cover up the coarse back surface as well as creating room
            for storing my electronics.
