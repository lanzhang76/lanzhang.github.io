            <h3>Design Methods</h3>

            <p>
              Big Idea:
              To use three design methods to explore how and what to design for an urban or wild animal of our choice, and to achieve the ultimate goal of creating an enriched dialogue with that animal.

          <p>Teammate: Max Klein</p>
            <p>Animal: Ring-tailed Lemur

              Max and I decided to move forward with Ring-tailed Lemurs who we still highly admire of their intelligence and intricate norms. Based on our knowledge and research from previous Enrichment projects, we wanted to dive deeper into Ring-tailed Lemurs’ behaviors that are beyond basic feeding and resting. Ring-tailed lemurs are highly sociable animals, and they demonstrate a complex communication system within their social groups. They travel and live in a group setting–so called lemur troops. Ring-tailed lemur troops are always female-dominant, and gender-based or age-based social behaviors emerge and display variously around that central theme. We were very intrigued by such a system and how it affected everything they do, so we agreed to explore further and ask more “why” on Ring-tailed Lemurs’ social hierarchy behaviors. In terms of creating a dialogue with Ring-tailed Lemur within that topic, we weren't sure about what exactly what we could design as an outcome, but we tried to keep our thoughts flowing and options open. Thus, using these three methods step by step can hopefully bring us insights and vantage points, leading us to an interesting intervention that will create a dialogue with Ring-tailed Lemurs.

            <h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
            <p>
              We originally started with listing everything Ring-tailed lemurs would do, underneath “Activity”, in response to displaying different behaviors within their social hierarchy. Once we moved into the “Interaction” section, we realized we listed all the interactions already underneath “Activity”.  That’s when we truly figured the different concentrations between the two and ended up finishing our chart as “IEAOU”.
