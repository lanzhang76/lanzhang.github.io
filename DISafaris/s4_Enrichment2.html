            <h3>Enrichment Prototype for Ring-tailed Lemurs</h3>

            <p>
              Big Idea:
              To create an enrichment intervention– a ground-based foraging extraction platform that challenges Ring-tailed lemurs to work for harvesting food through digging and probing, ultimately promoting their natural behaviors and improving welfare in a zoo setting.

            </p>

            <p><h4>Initial development goals:</h4>

                 1. Highlight the relation of behaviors to affordances in each of the proposals
                  <br>2. Invite the lemurs to interact with it
                  <br>3. Look for new behaviors rather than just sticking to the feeding mechanism
                  <br>4. Make the enrichment intervention challengingly and pleasantly engaged
                <br>5. Optimize the building structure and find durable materials for easier zoo maintenance
                  <br>6. Back up every behavior, steps of interaction with research and potential speculation

            </p>

            <p>While I’m exploring the answers to these questions, I started to do more research on specific behaviors and habits of Ring-tailed lemur, which will hopefully give me new insights into developing the affordances of any of my proposal. I found a report written by Tracy Fenn, the supervisor of mammals at Jacksonville Zoo, called “Behavior-based husbandry for lemurs.” He listed key points that further pinpoints the importance of creating based on species’ natural history and individual needs and creating responsive to objective evidence of welfare. It reminded me that my intervention will need to be durable, flexible in formats, and fits Lemurs’ natural behaviors.

            <div class="img_vertical">
              <img src="../image/Lemur/daySpent.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="img_vertical">
              <img src="../image/Lemur/activity.png" alt="">
            </div>


            <p>I encountered a paper called “Lemur Use of Hands Versus Mouth” that presented how most Ring-tailed lemurs are left-handed. Meanwhile, when foraging and feeding, Ring-tailed lemurs tend to use a single hand rather than both hands. How the was measured was through determining “If a hand was used to bring food or some other object to the mouth, the specific hand utilized was recorded”.
            </p>
              <div class="img_horizontal">
                <img src="../image/Lemur/hand.png" alt="">
              </div>
              <p>
              That means when interacting with the box, potentially Ring-tailed lemurs will probe and grab the food with one hand to deliver to the mouth. That means gauging the opening gaps doesn’t need to consider fitting both hands of a lemur as long as the gap fits one, and potentially their other hand will be simultaneously used to pull the string or dig into other gaps for food.
            </p>

            <p>
              More questions for developing the prototype for the "Ground foraging grid box":
              <br>1. What materials should I use for durability and safety?
              <br>2. How to make it more challenging and engaging for lemurs to interact with?
              <br>3. Will lemurs compete and incite fights with each other through food probing?
              <br>4. What if one claim territory over the box?
              <br>5. Can this box only exist on the ground/underground? Can it change form and replacement?
              <br>6. How to make it hard to break or to hack for the lemurs while easy for the zookeeper to maintain and update?
              <br>7. What are some of the specific locations within the captivated environment can this intervention be placed?
            </p>
